# image-volume-research-tools

Author: Maximus Chen

A collection of scripts and functions that Iâ€™ve developed for my research to do basic analysis on image volumes, particularly, segmentations of CT scans by deep learning algorithms.

The confusion_matrix_stats_calculator file is contains functions I wrote to calculate the confusion matrix and related stats such as F1 score of 3D image volume dataset comparisons. There is a demo script using this function that you can use but please see the function itself for documentation.

The key_phrase_folder_search file contains a function for searching a directory for a file containing a keyword or phrase in the file name.
