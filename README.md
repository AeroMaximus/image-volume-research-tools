# image-volume-research-tools

Author: Maximus Chen

A compilation of scripts and functions that Iâ€™ve developed to do analysis on image volumes, particularly, segmentations of CT scans by deep learning algorithms.

The confusion_matrix_stats_calculator function is one I developed to calculate the confusion matrix and related stats such as F1 score of dataset comparisons. There is a demo script using this function that you can use but please see the function itself for documentation.
