# image-volume-research-tools

A collection of Python scripts and functions that Iâ€™ve developed for my research to do basic analysis on image volumes, particularly, segmentations of CT scans by deep learning algorithms.

The confusion_matrix_stats_calculator file is contains functions I wrote to calculate the confusion matrix and related stats such as F1 score of 3D image volume dataset comparisons. There is a demo script using this function that you can use but please see the function itself for documentation.

The key_phrase_folder_search file contains a function for searching a directory for a file containing a keyword or phrase in the file name.

The Training Data selector script is still a work in progress, but it currently calculates the average image of a greyscale image stack dataset, takes the absolute value of subtracting the average image from every image to create absolute pixel intensity difference maps, and then averages those maps to assign every image an average pixel intensity difference. Since every image in the stack has an average pixel intensity difference 'score' that roughly determines how similar each image is to the entire dataset, we can select a mix of the local maximum and minimum scoring images to use as training data. Local minimums should be the images most similar to the entire dataset and thus hopefully representative of most of the dataset. Local maximums will be the most different images in the dataset and will add diversity to the training data.
